# Warehouse JustMock

This repo is a sample project to support the blog post I’ve written for Telerik called “Using mocks while unit testing ASP.NET Core app”, where I demonstrate how to implement an ASP.NET Core application and create mocks with Telerik JustMock.


### License

The current project includes methods (Mock.Arrange(), Mock.Create() and others) that are part of the commercial library Telerik JustMock.

To build the project locally you will need to obtain/use a free trial or commercial license of the product. 
For more information, you can head over to the [Telerik JustMock](https://www.telerik.com/products/mocking.aspx).
